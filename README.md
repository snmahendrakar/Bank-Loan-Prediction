This project is to automate the loan eligibility process. I have developed a model which will take input from the user. This Machine Learning model works on details such as gender, marital status, education, number of
dependents, income, loan amount, credit history. Loan eligibility of a customer can be determined efficiently by using this model. Specific customers who are eligible for loan amount can be targeted using this 
model.
